# Amazfit Health Monitor

A real-time wearable health monitoring system that collects health data from an Amazfit smartwatch using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), stores the data locally, and displays it through a live dashboard.

This project is designed as a wearable data bridge that can later be integrated into larger healthcare monitoring systems.

---

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a system that can:

- Connect with an Amazfit Bip U Pro smartwatch
- Collect live health-related data
- Store sensor data for later analysis
- Display health parameters through a dashboard
- Provide reusable data for future healthcare projects

---

## Target Device

Current development device:

- Amazfit Bip U Pro
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

---

## Planned Health Parameters

| Parameter | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Battery Level | Planned |
| Heart Rate | Planned |
| Steps | Planned |
| SpO2 | Planned |
| Stress | Research Phase |
